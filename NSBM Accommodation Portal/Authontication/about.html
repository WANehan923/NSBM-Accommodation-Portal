        <h2>About NSBM Green University Accommodation Portal</h2>
        <p>The NSBM Green University Accommodation Portal is a web application designed to help new students find suitable accommodation around the campus under the guidance of the new warden.</p>
        <p>The portal allows registered landlords/rental agencies to advertise their properties by providing details such as pictures, available facilities, location, and rental information. The warden can then view and validate these advertisements before approving or rejecting them.</p>
        <p>Students can browse through the listed accommodations, explore details about each property, and eventually rent them through the website.</p>
        <p>The webmaster (administrator) has the authority to create accounts for landlords, the warden, and the students, as well as post articles to improve awareness about finding proper accommodations.</p>
        <p>For any inquiries or feedback, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@nsbm.ac.lk">info@nsbm.ac.lk</a>.</p>
